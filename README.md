# Heart-Attack-Analysis-And-Prediction
This project consists of a jupyter notebook in which I created a model to predict whether or not a person will get a heart attack.
It also consists of some Exploratory Data Analysis in which I've made some insightful visualizations to understand the features in a better way.
